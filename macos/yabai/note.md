# Yabai Issues

-[ ] When an application window is closed, yabai could focus on a window which is not in the current space
     
     Using the query command may help?
     When destroying a window, find any window on the same space as the destorying window
     and focus on it after the window has been destroyed.

-[ ] Can't focus on a space
-[ ] Can't move spaces between monitors
